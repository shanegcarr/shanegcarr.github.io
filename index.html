                        <p class="research-text">My name is Shane Carr, and I am a fourth-year medical student at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. I am currently apply to anesthesiology residency programs and while I wait to find out where I'm going, I have been practicing coding by making this site from scratch.</p>

                        <p class="research-text">I'm originally from Phoenix, Arizona and completed an undergraduate degree in physiology at the University of Arizona. During that time, I studied the molecular mechanisms of pulmonary arterial hypertension, which you can read about in the research section of this site. Currently in medical school, my interests are medical education, working in our student-run free clinic, and postoperative outcomes research.</p>

                        <p class="research-text">Outside of school and work, I have a variety of hobbies I enjoy! I have been weight-training for 12 years now and ran my first half-marathon recently. I played for the University of Arizona rugby team in undergrad and also enjoyed playing soccer, racquetball, and volleyball with my friends. I have recently picked up chess again and play correspondance games online with both friends and strangers around the world. I also enjoy painting when I have something inspiring in mind, which you can find in the art page of this site. Lastly, I'm a huge fan of science-fiction books and have gotten into writing my own short stories.</p>
